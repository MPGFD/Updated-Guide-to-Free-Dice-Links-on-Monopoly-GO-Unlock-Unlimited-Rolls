## The Importance of Dice Rolls in Monopoly GO

Dice rolls in Monopoly GO determine your movement across the board, impacting your chances of acquiring properties, landing on bonuses, and participating in events. With limited dice rolls available daily, players must use them wisely or find ways to get more.

## How to Get Free Dice Links

Here are the primary ways players can access free dice:

### Official Social Media Channels

Scopely, the game developer, frequently posts free dice links on platforms such as:

* Facebook
* Instagram
* Twitter (now X)
* Discord

Following these channels ensures you stay informed about daily giveaways.

### Newsletters & Notifications

By subscribing to email newsletters or enabling in-game notifications, you can receive direct updates when new dice links are released.

### Community Forums

Reddit threads, Discord servers, and gaming forums often post fresh dice links shared by active players.

### Reward Events and Challenges

## How Free Dice Links Work

When you click on a free dice link:

* It redirects you to the Monopoly GO app (must be installed)
* If the link is valid, it credits the dice directly into your account
* Expired or previously claimed links won’t work again

Links usually have an expiration period (24–72 hours), so acting fast is essential.

## Best Practices to Maximize Free Dice

* **Check daily**: Most links are valid for a short time
* **Join active communities**: Reddit and Discord provide real-time updates
* **Keep the app updated**: Older versions may not redeem links correctly
* **Use link trackers**: Use spreadsheets or apps to track which links you’ve already claimed
* **Time your gameplay**: Save dice for special events or offers
